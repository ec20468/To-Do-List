## Reflection  

- **Context:** This project was a self-initiated challenge to solidify my understanding of core front-end web development principles.  
- **Goal:** Build a fully functional to-do list app without using any frameworks or libraries.  
- **Challenges:**  
  - **DOM Manipulation:** Creating and updating elements dynamically was a complex task that pushed me to deepen my understanding of DOM methods.  
  - **Real-Time Updates:** Maintaining accurate task counts and completed task counts without refreshing the page required careful event handling and state management.  

- **Unexpected Obstacles:**  
  - Handling multiple events efficiently and ensuring seamless user experience when interacting with the modal.  
  - Keeping the code modular and maintainable in a vanilla JavaScript environment.  

- **Technology Choices:**  
  - **Vanilla JavaScript over frameworks:** This decision allowed complete control over the codebase and reduced unnecessary overhead. By avoiding frameworks, I strengthened my fundamental understanding of DOM manipulation, event handling, and UI state management.  
  - **No external libraries:** Using only native web technologies ensured the app remained lightweight and fast, showcasing my ability to build robust applications without relying on pre-built solutions.  
  - **Minimal setup:** No need for Webpack, npm, or build tools. This project demonstrates how far you can go with just a browser and basic web technologies.

This project was a valuable learning experience in deepening my understanding of web fundamentals and improving my problem-solving skills in a pure JavaScript environment.
